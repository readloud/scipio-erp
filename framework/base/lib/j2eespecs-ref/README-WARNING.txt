SCIPIO: 2018-04-13: 
WARNING: THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER (SERVLET API) MUST NOT BE ADDED TO THE OFBIZ CLASSPATH!

These are for compilation and IDE usage only. However, it is usually NOT necessary to add this folder
to the ant build; the ant build can simply use the tomcat-provided API. This is primarily for the IDE,
in other words Eclipse.

The tomcat-provided servlet API is already loaded from the base/lib folder.
