SCIPIO ERP - Documentation Notes

For Scipio ERP introduction, please see the README file in the project root (where the main build.xml resides).

For major release documentation, visit the main website, http://www.scipioerp.com.

For current Templating API documentation, it is no longer distributed pre-compiled in the repository. 
Instead, it can be viewed on your local instance through the /admin application; look for "Templating Toolkit Documentation" in the menus.
It will give you the documentation matching your running instance version.
You may also view the documented source files for your instance version under:
/framework/common/webcommon/includes/scipio/lib
