## Discuss
We love exchanging with developers! For a quick chat we are always available at the [Community Forum](https://forum.scipioerp.com/). If you want to get in touch with a sales representative, [reach out to us](https://www.scipioerp.com/contact/).

## Report Bugs
Open a new issue to report any problem you may find. When you do:

* **Be descriptive**. The more you can tell us about it, the easier it is for us to fix the issue you are facing. Upload a screenshot if you can and tell us how we can reproduce the error you are seeing. 
* **Post an abstract of the error logs** Our logs are usually quite informative as to the errors you are seeing.. You can find the error logs inside of /runtime/logs/error*.log
* **Help us understand** It can be difficult to fully understand a problem - we know that this can be frustrating. Remember that we want to understand you the best we can, so if a discussion becomes lengthy, please bear with us. 

### Community Version
For users of the community version we prefer to hear about your errors on the official [Community Forum](https://forum.scipioerp.com/). You can also open up a Github issue, but for us to quickly take notice the forum is preferred.

### Enterprise Version
Enterprise Users can open up new issues at the official [Scipio ERP Extranet](https://gitlab.ilscipio.com/). You can share private information with us in your own project or open new issues for each project individually.
