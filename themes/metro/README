********************

Metro is a sample theme that is meant as a starting point for your own theme. 
Developer documentation is available on our website: https://www.scipio-erp.com/community/developer/views-requests/themes/


* CUSTOM HTML *
SCIPIO Commerce relies on a templating toolkit in the form of various freemarker macros 
that are used to generate the html. These macros can be overriden to match your own needs. 
All overrides are located within 

/includes/themeTemplate.ftl

In order to override a macro, copy over the original from the scipio library files, located in
component://common/webcommon/includes/scipio/lib/*.ftl and add your own changes inside 
your themeTemplate.ftl. This keep your own code maintainable and seperate from the other themes.



* CUSTOM CSS CLASSES *
In SCIPIO all css classes are stored in a configurable map that are then used as variables throughout
the system. The templating toolkit makes use of these to generate the overarching html. 
Overriding can be achieved by adding your own configuration to:

/includes/themeStyles.groovy

A complete list of all available variables is available in the following file:
component://common/webcommon/includes/scipio/lib/standard/htmlVariables.groovy

Please be aware, that the template provided is tailored towards Foundation CSS. 
A bootstrap alternative is available for purchase.



* CUSTOM CSS *
/webapp/metro/ contains a set of sass files that are used to generate the underlying css. SCIPIO
closely follows the build process outlined by http://foundation.zurb.com. 


* THEME STRUCTURE *
The theme consists of:

* /data/MetroThemeData.xml    Seed data for your theme, including css & js files to be included
* /includes/*     Freemarker templates used to generate the basic html frame (header, sidebar, footer)
* /webapp/metro/*   styles (here, the sass files used to generate the proper css)
