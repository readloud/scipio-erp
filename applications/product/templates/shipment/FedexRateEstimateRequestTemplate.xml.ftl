    SCIPIO: TODO: This file is not yet used by the Fedex rate estimate code,
    because ShipmentGatewayFedex.rateEstimateTemplate is not used.
    This is a placeholder file missing from upstream, but referred to in the data.
    It is added here in advance so that once ShipmentGatewayFedex.rateEstimateTemplate is exploited
    and implemented, it will not require a DB seeding or upgrade.
    See the other Fedex*.xml.ftl templates for basic format.
