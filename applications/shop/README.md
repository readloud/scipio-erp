# SCIPIO ERP - Default Shop
This is the default shop component.

For your own customization efforts, we recommend the creation of a child component, which inherits all of the shop
components features. This allows you to override all undesired aspects, insert new code and still remain compatible
with future updates to the component.

To create a child-component run from your scipio root directory:

```
./ant create-component-shop-override
```

A new component will be created in the hot-deploy directory.
