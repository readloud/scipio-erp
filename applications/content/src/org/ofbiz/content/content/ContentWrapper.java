     * <p>
     * SCIPIO: NOTE: This method's parameters' meanings and implementation is modified from stock Ofbiz.
     * Encoding is generally NOT DONE by this method anymore, with a few possible exceptions (such as url parameter encoding).
     * <p>
     * NOTE: 2016-10-14: Currently there is no encoding done by this method at all,
     * with possible URL parameter encoding to be added (TODO? see
     * {@link ContentLangUtil#getContentWrapperSanitizer(String)}).
     * <p>
     * In most cases, the language can be omitted and {@link #get(String)} can be used instead once core,
     * while the caller can (and often should) handle the languages.
     * <p>
     * In overwhelming majority of cases it is the templates' and screens' responsibility to encode
     * in the output document language at the proper point of use; usually done automatically by
     * screen html auto-escaping for html (which can be bypassed for non-html by caller).
     * <p>
     * The contentLang parameter here logically replaces encoderType and it denotes the intrinsic language
     * elements that may be contained in the specified content; but does NOT imply encoding
     * will be done in the named language.
     * <p>
     * In other words, "html" means the value may contain HTML markup, and "url" means
     * the value is a URL. It does not mean the markup will be html-escaped, although this
     * happens automatically by the screen automatic html-escaping when this is called
     * from freemarker or passed from groovy/screens to freemarker (so there are no added
     * security issues from removing the previous HTML encodings).
     * <p>
     * Currently, most code in SCIPIO no longer specifies "html" to this method and
     * uses {@link #get(String)} instead; only a few "url" are left.
     * <p>
     * For URL, individual parameters may get encoded, but unlike stock ofbiz, the URL
     * will not get slaughtered and is still subject to HTML and other encoding by caller/screens.
     * <p>
     * The implementations should make use of {@link ContentLangUtil}.
     * See {@link ContentLangUtil} for automatic encoding behavior.
     *
