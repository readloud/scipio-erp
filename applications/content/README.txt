SCIPIO:
DEPRECATION NOTE: 2016-10: In Scipio ERP, the content component has a reduced scope and usage, 
and several resources still present are considered obsolete and unsupported and 
may be removed/replaced at a later date. 

In general, it is now regarded as a code library only and not an application.

* The legacy Content web application user interface is deprecated and unsupported in Scipio ERP.
  The Content webapp remain remains enabled for serving non-UI requests and core functionality.
  Many screen file definitions are no longer relevant and subject to later removal.
* Most of the entity model related to CMS functionality will be supplanted in the near future.
  The more basic and generic entity model (Content, DataResource, etc.) is retained.
