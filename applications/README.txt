SCIPIO:
This is the applications directory.

This folder hosts the dominant business logic layer and schema.

In some cases, it may also host some logically low-level framework or high-level specific applications that
cannot be placed in other directories due to their dependencies on other applications or due to dependencies of other applications on them.
Ideally this should be avoided but in some cases is mandated.
